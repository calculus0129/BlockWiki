# BlockWiki
An encyclopedia based on the Proof of Stake method blockchain

  
Frequently used online encyclopedia, "Wikipedia", has its openness to compile certain documents freely and instantly. But various document trolling trouble(pranking with documents like deleting useful information, inserting false information, inserting unuseful information multiple times, etc.) has been occurred frequently through all languages. Even though Wikipedia has strengthen its editing policy, the main problem isn't solved.

To solve this matter, we are going to make a knowledge database system based on blockchain. Blockchain has its advantage to publicity, visibility, decentralized data storation, security, data restoration. We are going to use this advantage to solve this matter by Proof of Stake(PoS) method held by the users participating in the blockchain, so we could prevent wrong document edification or wrecking the whole document with the majority's opinion. We could afford stakes to the trusted users or proven professors, teachers, or other people with high responsibility.

In 2019, we are going to make this system using private blockchain to perform in high school size so we could analyze the result and feedback to our project. Hope we could provide the right and trustful knowledge to the world through this project.
